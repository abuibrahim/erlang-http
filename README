This is an Erlang/OTP application that includes HTTP/1.1 client and server.

It is similar to inets and supports pluggable modules, but exposes a slightly
different API.

One of the modules is http_mod_amf which implements Flex remoting services.
The build depends on erlang-amf.

Getting started:

git clone git://github.com/mujaheed/erlang-http.git
cd erlang-http
git submodule init
git submodule update
make
make run

open http://localhost:8080
