    <h1>Erlang-HTTP-Server</h1>
    <p>This is a high performance HTTP 1.1 server written in Erlang.
      It's main advantages compared to other web servers are performance
      and elegance. The performance comes from the underlying Erlang system
      and its ability to handle concurrent processes in an efficient way.
      Its elegance comes from Erlang as well. Network applications don't
      have to be written in ugly adhoc languages.</p>
